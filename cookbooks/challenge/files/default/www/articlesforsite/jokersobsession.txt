Jokers' Obsession with Batman
The man has a problem. Not only is he this crazy psychopath, but he just can't stop plotting against Batman. What's his deal? I'm just saying, this guy may be in it for more than just a few laughs. 
Whether or not he's into Batman or he just has this unhealthy addiction with causing Batman trouble, it is more than a bit odd. Sure he had Harley Quinn. Sure he probably had a wife. Does that rule out the fact that Batman was on his mind? He never shows any affection for Harley Quinn, anyways. 
I'm sure there is a lot of conflict on this topic in the community, but regardless of his motives, it's clear the Joker is set on putting Batman in the worst situations. He loves to make people uncomfortable and that may be why he acts so weirdly around people, especially Batman. 
Maybe the Joker is looking for some fun. He is a clown after all.
