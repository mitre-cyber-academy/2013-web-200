Bat Transit
The way Batman travels is a testament to his stature as a hero who uses technology to his advantage. Everyone remembers the Batmobile (Batman wouldn't be the same without it), but over time, Batman has needed a more diverse set of vehicles to serve his crime fighting obligations. 
The Batcycle
The Batcycle was great whenever the masked avenger wanted to take advantage of the twists and turns of Gotham to outsmart his driving-savy adversaries. I'm sure its aesthetic appeal won over Catwoman, as well. 
The Batcopter
If Batman really wanted to move, he'd call in the Batcopter. Just flying past his enemies would leave them toiled in fear. Plus, what rich guy doesn't have a helicopter, right?
The Bat
How much more realistic can it get? The Bat is basically a flying mechanical bat that allows Batman to fly around at great velocities carrying large payloads. And I'm pretty sure it only flies at night. Come on, it's a bat. Also, pretty sure no windshield. That's what sonar is for. 
The BatCamel
Coming soon...
No, it's not here.
