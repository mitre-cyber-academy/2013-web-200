Bat-a-rang
The Bat-a-rang is aerodynamic, sharp, and a generally awesome way to play with your dog at the park. If you see it coming near you, just run. Run. And run. Because once you see it coming towards you, it's already resting on top of your eyelid. 
With diamond edged wings and a pull-back extension, the Bat-a-rang is a true engineering marvel. If a person could compress a real bat between layers of steel and metal, it would be called the Bat-a-rang. I mean, what was Batman thinking when he made this thing? He never uses it in battle! Does he tie a fishing line to it and wrap his enemies like Spiderman's web? Is he jealous? Insecure? 
Or was he trying to make a bat ship and accidentally put it under the shrink ray? If so, how many Batmobiles have been boomarangafied? Too many questions left unanswered. 
Either way, I'm sure the people of Gotham would love to see random Bat-a-rangs stuck into the side of trees, lightposts, etc. Imagine coming home and telling your parents that you had been playing catch with a deep-voiced stranger in a Bat suit. Could you imagine their reaction? 
That is probably one of the many reasons he's made sure not to use it very often. Covering his tracks is numero uno on the list for the masked hero.
Sorry, this isn't it.
